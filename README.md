# Distance Calculator & Shipper Data Web App

This web application is designed to provide two main features: distance calculation between Indian cities and displaying shipper data. It's a React-based application that offers an intuitive user interface for these functionalities.

# Features
1. Distance Calculator
The "Distance Calculator" feature allows users to calculate the total cost of traveling between two Indian cities, taking into account a straight-line distance. It provides the following options:

Select a starting city from a dropdown list.
Select an ending city from a dropdown list.
Optionally, select a middle stop city from a dropdown list to calculate the cost of a route with a stopover.
The application uses the provided coordinates of Indian cities to calculate the cost, assuming that traveling between cities costs 100 Rs per unit distance.

2. Shipper Data
The "Shipper Data" feature enables users to explore information about shippers and their service areas. It provides the following functionalities:

Select a city from a dropdown list to filter available shippers.
Sort shippers in ascending or descending order based on their ratings.
